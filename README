PeaksToGenes


INSTALLATION

Installation of PeaksToGenes has been tested on Debian Linux
and OS X. It is not configured to work with Windows.

This module has three non-Perl dependencies: BedTools, SQLite3, and MySQL.

To install BedTools:

	BedTools should be compiled from source. The current package in the
	apt-get repositories has been updated to function better.

	* BedTools has a dependency on zlib. The 'make' command will fail
	* if this is not installed. On OS X this can be installed from
	* source <>http://www.zlib.net/
	* On Ubuntu:
		sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev

		Get the source package for the BedTools:
		<http://code.google.com/p/bedtools/downloads/list>

		tar -zxvf BEDTools.<version>.tar.gz 
		cd BEDTools<version>
		make clean
		make all
		ls bin

		# copy the binaries to a directory in your PATH. e.g., 
		sudo cp bin/* /usr/local/bin
		# or
		cp bin/* ~/bin

To install SQLite3

	On Debian Linux:

		sudo apt-get install sqlite3

	On OS X:

		Download the precompiled binary from:
		<http://www.sqlite.org/download.html>

		Copy the binary file to your PATH e.g.
		sudo cp sqlite3 /usr/local/bin/

To install MySQL

	On Debian Linux:

		[ Note that with Ubuntu 12.04LTS MySQL may already be
		installed]
		sudo apt-get install mysql-server

	On OS X:

		Download the OS-specific .DMG file from:
		<http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/>

		Follow the installation instructions.

Perl Dependencies:

One of the easiest ways to install a working version of this application,
once external dependencies (non-Perl) have been met is to use PerlBrew and
cpanminus to install everything needed as a non-root user using local::lib.

Please visit <http://perlbrew.pl/> for PerlBrew installation instructions.
PerlBrew includes a convenient command 'perlbrew intstall-cpanm', which
will install cpanminus in your user directory. If you choose to use
system-wide Perl and cpanminus for the installation of Perl dependencies,
please visit <http://cpanmin.us> for installation instructions.

Please note that installation of a local version of Perl may take some
time, depending on the machine.

This version of peaksToGenes was written and tested using Perl 5.14.2

If cpanminus has been installed, from the peaksToGenes directory, run the
./cpanm_install.pl script. If all non-Perl dependencies are met, the
required Modules and their Perl Module dependencies should be installed by
cpanminus. If there are problems installing Module dependencies, cpanminus
will write these to the log file in your home directory.

PeaksToGenes has the following Perl module dependencies:

Moose
Moose::Util::TypeConstraints
MooseX::Getopt
Carp
Data::Dumper
FindBin
File::Which
DBI
DBIx::Class::Schema
DBIx::Class::Core
DBD::SQLite
DBD::mysql
Parallel::ForkManager
Statistics::ANOVA
Statistics::Test::WilcoxonRankSum
Statistics::Zed

** Please note that if you are installing DBD::mysql as a non-root user, it
is likely that the tests will fail unless your username has all privileges
for the test database. If the installation for DBD::mysql fails, try
running 'cpanm install DBD::mysql` then check the log file for instructions
on how to change permissions for testing. Alternatively, you can install
this module without testing using 'cpanm --notest DBD::mysql', however,
this may result in unexpected behavior. **

If you choose to install these Perl Modules system-wide, you will need root
access, and can be installed using CPAN (unless of course you have
configured CPAN to use local::lib - which can be tricky).
To install on any system, use CPAN e.g.

	$ sudo cpan
	> install Moose
	> install DBIx::Class::Schema
	> install DBI
	etc.


Once all of the dependencies have been updated, please add the path to $/PeaksToGenes/bin/
to either your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile file to allow for system-wide calling of
PeaksToGenes.

Some of these Perl dependencies require a 'make' function. When given an
error message to this end, please consult with your package distributor to
install the appropriate companion tools.
